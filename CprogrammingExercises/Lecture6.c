//************************** Exercise 6_1 ************************
//Party exercise. Let’s assume one person drinks 3 (constant) beers in an hour.
// Write a C code and your own function that calculates the number of beers
// (unsigned integer) you will need if you invite your friends for a party?
// The number of guests (unsigned short) and the party duration length
// (in hours - float) you read in from the keyboard.

//************************** Exercise 6_2 ************************
//2. Calculator exercise.
//a. Create functions, that calculate the sum, subtraction, multiplication and
//   division of two numbers. The two numbers are passed to the function as arguments.
//b. Organize these functions into own-created header files and source files
//c. Read two numbers (type double) from the keyboard for the calculation.
//   Create a menu system, that will prompt the user to choose the operation
//   choice (+, -, * or /) (can be a character or number from 1 to 4 – use
//   switch-case control structure). After the operation is selected, the
//   corresponding function is called and the operation is performed. See the sample below.

//  Enter your two numbers: 12 15
//      MENU
//      1. Add
//      2. Subtract
//      3. Multiply
//      4. Divide
//  Enter your choice: 3
//  Result: 12 * 15 = 180
